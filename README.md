# Driver API Documentation
Documentation for the Driver-centric API for GPS Insight. This API is responsible for providing data for the 
GPS Insight Driver App, for [IOS](ios-app) and [Android](android-app).

[GPS Insight][gps-insight] provides vehicle fleet GPS tracking and FMCSA-compliant electronic logging devices (ELD)
for regulating hours of service (HOS). GPS Insight's API (V2) provides a programmatic way to push your fleet's data
from our system to your back-end systems (e.g., ERP, Dispatch, CRM). By using our API you can effortlessly integrate
your fleet's data into your back-end systems to provide transparency into payroll, fuel card transactions, additional
documentation, asset management, and more.

Be sure to sign up for an account and follow the directions to get API credentials before using this library.
